# py-DCCA
This python code was developped during my internship at LARIS (http://laris.univ-angers.fr/fr/index.html).

This repository allows detrended cross correlation analysis with python.
It is a robust method, introduced by Podobnik and Stanley (https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.100.084102), to quantify the intercorrelation between two non-stationary time signals.
It has been tested on ARFIMA (AutoRegressive Fractional Integral Moving Average) signals to obtain the results of the article by Podobnik and Stanley.

This package use the numpy package (http://numpy.scipy.org)
